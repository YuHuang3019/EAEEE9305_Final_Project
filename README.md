# EAEEE9305_Final_Project
This repository contains all the codes for the final project of course EAEEE9305. The procedures are listed below.

1. Pair the AVHRR with Yao Zhang's MODIS & AVHRR data.

2. Apply clustering or outlier detection methods to remove the outliers (available variables to use: MODIS red and NIR bands; AVHRR red, NIR, brightness temperatures at 3.75 microns and 12 microns).

3. Use a feedforward neural network to predict SIF with AVHRR red and NIR bands.

4. Plot a few maps and time series and compare the predicted data with observations.
